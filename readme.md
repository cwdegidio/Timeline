# Timeline
Timeline is a responsive HTML 5 horizontal element that includes detail modals when hovering over the date. Javascript calculates the necessesary offsets of list item children in an ordered list.


## How to use
### HTML
Each list item contains and individual date and a detail about the date. Each list item is setup as follows:

```
<li>
      <time>Date</time>
      <span class="details">
        Sample text for details modal.
      </span>
</li>
```

The date is placed in the time tag and the detail is placed between the spans.

## Enjoy!
